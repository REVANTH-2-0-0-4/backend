# Data Storage

## Why Can't We Store Everything in a File?

- Files are good for storing **text**, but they aren't efficient for **photos, audio, or videos**.
- Storing binary data like images, audio, and videos in files is cumbersome and inefficient.
- **Databases** provide an efficient way to store and manage all types of data, including binary formats.

---

## **What is a Database?**

A **Database** is a system designed to store and manage data efficiently. It handles various data types, such as:

- **Images**
- **Audio**
- **Video**
- Other binary formats

---

## **Types of Databases**

### **1. SQL Databases**
- Use a structured format (tables) to store data.
- **Tables** organize data visually but store it in scattered memory locations.
- **SQL queries** enable data manipulation and retrieval.

### **2. NoSQL Databases**
- Use objects instead of tables for storing data.
- Flexible and suitable for handling complex structures.
- **MongoDB** is a widely-used NoSQL database, especially in modern web applications.

---

## **Why MongoDB for MERN Stack?**

- Flexible and scalable to handle complex, hierarchical data.
- Integrates seamlessly with the JavaScript-based MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

---

## **Server Terminologies**

### **What is a Server?**
A **server** provides services or resources to other computers (**clients**) over a network.

### **Types of Servers**
1. **File Server**: Manages files like documents, photos, and videos.
2. **Game Server**: Syncs game states in multiplayer environments.
3. **Web Server**: Delivers web content in response to browser requests.
4. **Database Server**: Acts as a digital librarian, managing data.

---

## **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**
### **What It Is**
- Maps code objects to relational database rows (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### **Advantages**
- Simplifies database interactions without writing raw SQL.
- Enhances portability across databases.

---

## **Object Data Modeling (ODM)**
### **What It Is**
- Maps application code objects to NoSQL database documents (e.g., MongoDB).

### **Advantages**
- Ideal for schema-less, flexible data models.

---

## **Mongoose-Specific Features**

### **Document Structure**

1. **ID Field (`_id`)**
   - Automatically added to every MongoDB document.
   - A unique **12-byte hexadecimal value**, divided as:
     - **4 bytes**: Timestamp (document creation time).
     - **5 bytes**: Machine identifier (ensures global uniqueness).
     - **3 bytes**: Process ID (ensures process-level uniqueness).

2. **Version Key (`__v`)**
   - Added by Mongoose for **version control**.
   - Helps detect and prevent conflicting updates during concurrent modifications.

---

### **Notes on Mongoose Operations**
- **All Mongoose Operations Are Asynchronous**:
  - Return **Promises** by default, enabling non-blocking execution.
  - Use `.then()`, `.catch()`, or `async/await` for handling results effectively.

---

### **Database Versioning in Mongoose (`__v`)**

#### **Purpose of `__v`**
- Used for **version control** in documents.
- Detects and prevents conflicting updates in concurrent environments.

#### **How It Works**
1. Documents are fetched with their `__v` value.
2. During updates, Mongoose checks if the `__v` matches the current version in the database.
3. If a mismatch occurs, a conflict is detected, and an error is thrown.

#### **Use Cases**
- **Concurrent Updates**: Prevents data loss during simultaneous modifications.
- **Conflict Detection**: Ensures stale data isn't used for updates.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Encourages resolving conflicts by retrying updates with fresh data.

#### **Customizing Versioning**
- **Disable Versioning**: `{ versionKey: false }`
- **Rename the Version Key**: `{ versionKey: 'customKeyName' }`

---

### **Customizing Mongoose Behavior**
- `_id` and `__v` fields are added automatically unless explicitly configured otherwise.
- Mongoose's built-in features provide flexibility for managing data models efficiently.

---

## **Terminologies in Databases**

| **Code**            | **Theory**              |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Connect Mongoose    | Create a database       |
| Create a model      | Create a collection     |
| Create (Code)       | Document creation       |

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. The `_id` field ensures data integrity and provides globally unique identifiers for documents.
2. The `__v` field supports version control, preventing data conflicts during updates.
3. Mongoose operations are asynchronous, requiring proper handling for execution flow.
