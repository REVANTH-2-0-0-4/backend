### Application Flow Documentation

#### **1. Server Startup**
- **File**: `server.js`
  - This is the entry point of the application.
  - Starts the server and imports `app.js`.

---

#### **2. Application Initialization**
- **File**: `app.js`
  - Responsible for initializing the application.
  - Connects to the database by importing the `db` module.
  - Sets up middleware and routes.
  - Imports routes from the `routes` folder.

---

#### **3. Routes Handling**
- **Folder**: `routes/`
  - Contains route definitions for different features (e.g., user routes).
  - **Example**: `user.routes.js`
    - Forwards user-related requests to their respective controllers.
    - Imported into `app.js` for registration.

---

#### **4. Request Flow**
- **Step-by-Step**:
  1. **Route Trigger**:
     - Example: A request hits the `register` route.
  2. **Validation**:
     - Uses `express-validator` to validate the request body.
     - Validation logic resides in the route definition or middleware.
  3. **Controller Invocation**:
     - After validation, the corresponding controller function (e.g., `createusercontroller`) is called.
  4. **Error Handling**:
     - The controller checks for validation errors using `validationResult` from `express-validator`.
     - If errors exist, responds with `400 Bad Request` and the error details.
  5. **Service Interaction**:
     - If the request is valid, the controller calls a service (e.g., `userservice.createuser`) to handle business logic.
     - Services handle third-party interactions, such as database operations.
  6. **Response**:
     - The controller returns the response to the client (e.g., a success message or token).

---

#### **5. Folder Responsibilities**
- **`db/`**:
  - Contains database connection and models.
  - Example: `user.model.js` defines the user schema and model.
- **`routes/`**:
  - Defines route-specific logic and forwards requests to controllers.
- **`controllers/`**:
  - Handles request validation, error handling, and response generation.
  - Calls services for business logic.
- **`services/`**:
  - Encapsulates third-party communication logic (e.g., database queries).
  - Example: Interacting with MongoDB via `mongoose`.

---

#### **Example Flow for Register Route**
1. **Client Request**:
   - A POST request is sent to `/register` with user details in the body.
2. **Route Handling**:
   - `user.routes.js` validates the request using `express-validator` and forwards it to `createusercontroller`.
3. **Controller**:
   - Validates request body using `validationResult`.
   - Calls `userservice.createuser` to handle user creation logic.
   - Generates a token and sends it as a cookie in the response.
4. **Service**:
   - Creates a new user in the database using the `user` model.
   - Returns the created user instance to the controller.

---

#### **Notes**
- Validation must occur at the route level before forwarding to the controller.
- Services abstract all third-party operations to maintain separation of concerns.
- The response should always be generated by the controller, not the service.
- rawflow  : --> 
first server.js will be started as it is the main file , 
now since app.js is imported  in it , it will also get loaded and database gets connected since, the db is imported in app.js
next  in routes folder  : we created the user routes, to where all the user routes will be forwarded , since the router has been imported in the app.js  --> then lets say  we are calling the registerroute  the express validator  validates the body field in the req  as we say and it goes to usercontroller checks for any errors from express validator(we need to import the expressvalidator here too , since we are using its methods(validationResult))  , usercontroller  now uses userservices to create an user and returns the response ( this will be the flow for every route (kind of mostly ))
