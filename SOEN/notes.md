# Difference between CommonJS and ES Modules

## Key Differences
- **Syntax**:
- CommonJS uses `require()` for importing modules and `module.exports` for exporting.
- ES Modules use `import` and `export` keywords.
- **File Extensions**:
- CommonJS does not require file extensions.
- ES Modules require specifying file extensions while importing (e.g., `.js`, `.mjs`).
- **Execution**:
- CommonJS modules are loaded synchronously.
- ES Modules are loaded asynchronously.

# Statics in a Schema
- **Definition**:
- Statics in a schema are methods that are defined at the schema level rather than the document level.
- They are used for operations that are relevant to the model as a whole rather than an individual document.

---

# Express Validator
- **Overview**:
- We are using an Express Validator package specifically designed for Express.js.
- It provides validation and sanitization middleware for Express applications.
- It is similar in functionality to Joi but is tailored for Express.js.

# methods vs statics in a model
| **Aspect** | **Statics** | **Methods** |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Scope** | Operates on the model (all documents). | Operates on a single document instance. |
| **Access** | Called on the model (e.g., `User`). | Called on a document (e.g., `user`). |
| **`this` Context** | Refers to the model itself. | Refers to the specific document. |
| **Use Case** | General operations like querying, aggregation, etc. | Specific operations like modifying or validating data of the document. |
