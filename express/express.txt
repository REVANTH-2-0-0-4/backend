express is a npm package and is a framework(it gives a flow )
express js  take cares of everything from recieving the request and sending the response 
what is a  middleware ? 
does something when something is sent from the server to the route ? 
cookies and server  
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended : true}));
the above two middlewares are used to   parse the incoming json and url encoded data in req.body 
// GLOBAL middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
    next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route
});

// for a specific route
app.use('/admin', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Admin section accessed');
    next();
});
