# Backend Learning Journey 🛠️

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning backend development using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It contains the projects, experiments, and code snippets I’ve worked on to strengthen my backend skills.

Stay tuned as I continue to explore and build exciting projects! 🚀.
